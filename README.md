tray\_rust - A Toy Ray Tracer in Rust
===
This is a port of my physically based ray tracer [tray](https://github.com/Twinklebear/tray) to
[Rust](http://www.rust-lang.org) to learn the language and have some fun. It's probably not a good example
to look at if you're trying to find well written Rust code, since I'm learning the language.
